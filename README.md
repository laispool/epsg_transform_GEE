# Tranformation of bathymetry data's EPSG
## for [Earth Engine](https://code.earthengine.google.com/) platform

This code was made to transform the coordinate system of a bathymetry data, from WGS84 (UTM 22 South) to WG84 (geographic coordinate system).
Furthermore, you can change this part of the code to adjust for your own data's ``EPSG``. You can look for the EPSG codes on the link below:
